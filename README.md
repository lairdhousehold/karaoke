# karaoke

I made a karaoke application using AngularJS, the Youtube search and iframe APIs, and utilizing the MediaStream web API. 
I use AdBlock for YouTube when running this because the bottom-justified YouTube ads often cover lyrics.


### todo/hopes and dreams:
* playlist/queue
* adjustable reverb for mic stream
* mute button for mic
* fullscreen toggle
* responsive video sizing
* dual mic support
* search results paging
